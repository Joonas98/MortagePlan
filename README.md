# MortagePlan
This project is deployed in Azure: https://mortageplan20230921133942.azurewebsites.net/MortageCalculator/Index
You can use this website to create, edit, delete and view customers.
Each customer has an ID (unique for each), name, total loan, interest %, years in which they plan to pay. These variables are used to calculate how much they need to pay each month.
The data is stored in a SQL database in Azure.

Many files are default ASP.NET functionality. To see the most interesting stuff written by me, check the files in here: MortagePlan -> Pages -> MortageCalculator

Important note: all the "customers" are fictional and they could be added by anyone from anywhere.
